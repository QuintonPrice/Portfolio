        "content": "My name is Quinton Price! I'm a junior Computer Science student from the Seattle, WA area. I'm currently studying at Walla Walla University, where I will graduate in 2023. I currently work at Mutual of Enumclaw as a help desk analyst during summers and at my university's outdoor organization as a trip leader and website manager during the schoolyear. I have a strong interest in web development, specifically using frameworks such as React. I enjoy learning new languages and libraries, such as developing Android apps, Python bots, and more. <br /> <br /> Going forward in my career, I am looking to work in front-end development, app development, or similar projects. Writing code that creates visual, tangible changes is what I enjoy the most. With that being said, backend development is something I would like to learn more about and understand. Working with frameworks and libraries that allow the developer to create tangible, useable features for users or businesses is my primary focus as I continue in my education. Using frameworks such as ReactJS and suites such as Android Studio has been a highlight for me. <br /> <br /> Aside from technology, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors, whether it be mountain biking, skiing, backpacking, or running. Some of my fondest memories are from family camping trips, mountain biking, and skiing. My dad introduced me to mountain biking at a young age and it's something I still thoroughly enjoy to this day. Recently, I have been getting into backpacking and climbing. Exploring nature and enjoying everything that the area I live in has to offer is something I look forward to on weekends and free time. I also enjoy watching motorsports, such as Formula One and rally racing. <br /> <br />"
