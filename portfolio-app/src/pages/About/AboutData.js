        "content": "&nbsp My name is Quinton Price! I'm a sophomore Computer Science student from Seattle, WA. I'm currently studying at Walla Walla University, where I will graduate in 2023. I have a strong interest in web development, specifically using frameworks such as React. I enjoy learning new languages and libraries, such as developing Android apps, Python bots, and more. <br /> <br /> &nbsp Going forward in my career, I am looking to work in front-end development, app development, or similar projects. Writing code that creates visual, tangible changes is what I enjoy the most. With this being said, backend development is something I would like to learn more about and understand. Working with frameworks and libraries that allow the developer to create tangible, useable features for users or businesses is my primary focus as I continue in my education. Using frameworks such as ReactJS and suites such as Android Studio has been a highlight for me. <br /> <br /> &nbsp Aside from technology, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors, whether it be mountain biking, skiing, backpacking, or running. Some of my fondest memories are from family camping trips, mountain biking, and skiing. My dad introduced me to mountain biking at a young age and it is something I still thoroughly enjoy to this day. Recently, I have been getting into backpacking and climbing. Exploring nature and enjoying everything that the area I live in has to offer is something I look forward to. I also enjoy watching motorsports, such as Formula One and rally racing. <br /> <br />"
