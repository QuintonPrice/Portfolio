I have a strong interest in web development, specifically using frameworks such as React. I enjoy learning new languages and libraries, such as developing Android apps, Python bots, and more. <br /> <br /> &nbsp Aside from technology, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors, whether it be mountain biking, skiing, backpacking, or running. Some of my fondest memories are from family camping trips, mountain biking, and skiing. My dad introduced me to mountain biking at a young age and it is something I still thoroughly enjoy to this day. I also enjoy watching motorsports, such as Formula One and rally racing. <br /> <br />"
