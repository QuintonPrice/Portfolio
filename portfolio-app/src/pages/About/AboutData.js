        "content": "My name is Quinton Price! I'm a junior computer science student from the Seattle, WA area. I'm currently an incoming software engineering intern at Alaska Airlines. I'm studying at Walla Walla University, where I will graduate in 2023. During the school year, I work at my university's outdoor organization as a trip leader and website manager. I have a strong interest in web and app development, specifically using frameworks like React. I enjoy learning new languages and libraries, such as developing Android apps, Python bots, and more. <br /> <br /> Going forward in my career, I am looking to work in front-end development, app development, or similar projects. Writing code that creates visual, tangible changes is what I enjoy the most! Using frameworks such as ReactJS and suites such as Android Studio has been a highlight for me as they have allowed me to create functional apps from scratch. <br /> <br /> Aside from technology, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors, whether it be mountain biking, skiing, backpacking, climbing, or running. Some of my fondest memories are from family camping trips, mountain biking, and skiing. My dad introduced me to mountain biking at a young age and it's something I still thoroughly enjoy to this day. Enjoying the nature around me is something I look forward to on weekends and free time. I also closely follow Formula One, as the competition and engineering involved is fascinating to me. <br /> <br />"
