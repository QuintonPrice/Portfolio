I'm studying at Walla Walla University, where I will graduate in 2023. During the school year, I work at my university's outdoor organization as a trip leader and website manager. I have a strong interest in web and app development, specifically using frameworks like React. I enjoy learning new coding languages and libraries, such as developing Android/iOS apps, Python bots, and more. <br /> <br /> Going forward in my career, I am looking to work in front-end development, app development, or similar projects. Writing code that creates visual, tangible results is what I enjoy the most! Using frameworks such as ReactJS and suites such as Android Studio has been a highlight for me as they have allowed me to create functional apps from scratch. Aside from front-end and app development, I have been learning more about databases, a topic that I have implemented to create more detailed and functional apps. <br /> <br /> Aside from technology, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors mountain biking, skiing, backpacking, climbing, and running. Living in Washington, some of my favorite memories are from spending time in the Snoqualmie Pass and Cascade regions with my family. I grew up camping with my family, mountain biking, and skiing with my parents. My dad introduced me to mountain biking at a young age and it is something I still thoroughly enjoy to this day. Enjoying the nature around me is something I look forward to on weekends and free time, whether it be skiing a small mountain in eastern Washington, backpacking to a scenic point in the Cascades, or mountain biking in the I90 corridor. I also closely follow Formula One, as the competition and engineering involved is fascinating to me. <br /> <br />"
